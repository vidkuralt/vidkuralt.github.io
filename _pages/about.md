I am a scientist and entrepreneur, building artificial intelligence technologies to power breakthroughs in biology and medicine.I am a pharmacy researcher and PhD student, exploring drug discovery through medicinal chemistry, computational modeling and machine learning.

**Short Bio**

Vid Kuralt is a PhD student at the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, researching drug discovery at the intersection of medicinal chemistry, computational modeling, and machine learning.

**Long Bio**

Vid Kuralt is a PhD student at the Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Ljubljana, where his research focuses on the design and discovery of novel drug candidates using an integrated approach that combines medicinal chemistry, molecular modeling, and artificial intelligence. His academic background bridges experimental and computational sciences, with experience in chemical synthesis, molecular docking, pharmacophore modeling, and data-driven approaches to predict drug-target interactions.

Passionate about advancing the role of AI in pharmaceutical research, Vid’s work explores how computational methods can accelerate early-stage drug discovery and improve our understanding of molecular mechanisms in biology. He has contributed to projects involving both in silico drug screening and wet-lab validation, reflecting his interest in translational applications of bioinformatics and machine learning to medicinal chemistry.

Looking ahead, Vid is dedicated to bridging the gap between computational predictions and experimental validation, with the goal of developing more effective and efficient strategies for discovering therapies.
